## Now: Bellows of Optimism (2023)

Often, I would willingly surrender to the bed of thorns, the thorns that I crafted with my own hands. Take me, deeper into the thickness where I can no longer see. Escape seemed impossible, yet, I emerge. Those thorns, once a prison, have transformed into stepping stones on route to life. Once blinded, I stand in the light, triumphant over what kept me entombed for so long. I am courageous, I am optimistic, I believe.

## Chapters: A Leap into the Unknown (2005 - 2013)

I have so many chapters in my life, but I'll try my best to keep this short. People close to me will probably tell you I can ramble quite a bit.

### The Middle East

In 2005, my family took the leap to move to Saudi Arabia where my dad, a computer programmer, had been living for work. I spent 8 years there, and it was 8 years of a warm embrace. I was incredibly fortunate that my parents took this detour in their life, as I was sent to an american international school where I got to meet and make friends that were from all over the world. Some of my closest friends were from India, Lebanon, Germany, America and Syria. I got to learn and indulge in so many different cultures from a young age, and it all felt so natural. We lived in a compound in the heart of Riyadh, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We took an old dingy bus to school with the most hilarious, and (rightfully so) grumpy bus driver. Some of us were not so well behaved, often seat belts were seen as anything but a life saving device, more an annoying bump where you were trying to sit. But, to cut matters short, in 2013 my older brother had finished his senior year and my parents made yet another hard decision to move us back to our home, a home that did not feel as such to me.

### Back in Mordor

And Mordor it was. For the past 8 years, all I knew was living in a secluded compound and going to school at a posh private school in the middle of a desert, where I could learn to program lego robots and speak Spanish. My dad made the final decision when picking out my new school, and he said "he can go to that school just down the road, it's a 5 minute walk!"

Upper Hutt College. I was so incredibly scared, you knew exactly who played rugby by taking a glance at their giant quads and full beard at the age of 14. I had even gone to view a rugby game the week before I started, watching the school's 1st XV play against Onslow College, and I saw the most humungous human being receive the ball and crash into two Onslow boys and knock them both out cold at the same time. No pressure, skinny little ginger Jakob, you'll fit in just fine.

But, even through my anxiety, I was embraced once again. I made friends quickly, and accepted my new name of 'Ranga'. Unfortunately, I still had a hard time adjusting to my fellow students swearing at our teachers or kicking dents into cabinet files for fun.

### Dealing with Loss

After five years of being at Upper Hutt College and in my final year at 17 years old, things really felt like they were going great. I had an amazing group of friends that I gamed with after school every day, we planned a trip to Taupo, and our group plus another 30 or 40 students were excited to be leaving to Europe for a school trip in a few weeks.

But, about a week before the Europe trip, my mum and I were sitting at the dinner table wondering why my dad hadn't come back home or even mentioned where he was. We ate dinner anyway, and I decided I'd go back to gaming with my friends. I don't know how long later, but I heard a knock on the door that I let my mum answer. I thought I started to hear crying, and took my headphones off. I knew right away, and told my friends in the call "I think my dad has died".

I walked to the front door to see my mum in tears and police officers outside. They had let us know that my dad was driving home and had suffered a heart attack. My poor mother, who is only filled with love and hope. My poor brother, who was living away from us in Palmerston North. My poor, poor father who was studying and working so hard to give us all a better life.

My 17 year old self tucked all of my emotion away, I had to be strong, I told myself. This is a battle, and I will win. I gave my mum a great big hug, and told her it's going to be okay. We're going to make this work.

### The Leap of Faith

In February 2018, I'm now 18 and fresh out of Year 13, I faced the daunting question of what's next. A late enrollment into Weltec's Bachelor of Information Technology, the same one my dad was doing just a few months before, didn't stick with me. I couldn't do it, and I hid away from what was eating at me instead of facing it head on.

There was a battle, and I will win. But, I never understood I was running from the battle the entire time.

I instead made a last-minute switch to Victoria University with my best friend, Stefan. Opting for a Psychology/Media Studies major with a Marketing minor, I discovered that traditional lectures weren't my style. I couldn't focus during a lecture, I left all of my work last minute, and gaming was more of a priority than anything else.

I don't remember much this year, and I think the reason is obvious.

## The Horror of 2019: Facing Failure

The year 2019 marked a personal low as I failed University in 2018 and grappled with the unprocessed grief of losing my father. It became clear that I needed help, prompting me to reach out and take the necessary steps towards self-improvement. This transformative year included seeking guidance from a therapist to navigate the challenges I faced.

I would go for walks at 1AM. I stayed inside and gamed all day every day. I was slowly losing touch with my friends. But, my amazing, loving, caring and beautiful mother stood by my side no matter what. I don't know where I would be without her, and where I am today is driven from her intense love.

Talking to a therapist saved me more than I understood at the time. I had 6 free sessions, and the difference between the first and last session was night and day. I was filled with a desire to do something, anything. No longer would I let my intrusive thoughts tell me how to live my life. Sure, it was what I knew and what I was comfortable with, but are you really comfortable laying in a bed of thorns?

After working on myself again, going to the gym, getting up early, I decided it was time to take the next step. I looked inwards, and asked myself what I want to do. "Computers", I told myself. I loved being on a computer, and always have. My earliest memories are my dad sitting me up on a computer chair to play a demo of FarCry for goodness sake, just take the plunge and do it.

In Saudi Arabia, I taught myself how to use Photoshop to make logos for clans and gaming organisations that I was apart of. So, I signed up for a design course.

## Design: A Creative Detour (2020)

Taking a leap into the world of design seemed like the natural next step. With a passion already proven through involvement in clans and video games, I enrolled in Yoobee Colleges. This creative endeavor turned out to be an brilliant stepping stone, reigniting my enthusiasm for learning.

I loved that I wanted to learn. I finished and received a certificate in Creative Media Design in July 2020, and decided to move on to Web and Graphic design for my next achievement. It was a diploma that went indepth about designing for the web and physical products, and it had a touch of coding in there as well--a pivotal element that sparked a revelation.

I was half way through this diploma and was looking at going back to Vic for computer science or, possibly, Weltec to do what I should have done in the first place, the Bachelor of Information Technology. Interestingly enough, as I was searching for an answer, Yoobee themselves had just come out with a Software Engineering degree for the Wellington campus, with an oppurtunity for a scholarship to have the degree fully funded.

I applied. And received an email about the scholarship. The next three years of my life were now set, and I finally understood that I needed to accept the battle. Here I stood, looking at the path infront of me, and I couldn't help but think of my father. Had he been here, the excitement and grin he would have had on his face to guide me through this chapter of my life would have been one of life's most beautiful sights. I was happy, and I know he would have been too.

## The Fountain of Life: Engineering a Future (2021 - Now)

I am surprised if you've made it this far. I did warn you that I ramble.

The allure of watching my father code throughout my life was always present, yet I had convinced myself that it was beyond my reach. In 2021, I finally embraced the world of programming, realizing it had been right in front of me all along.

Admittedly, Yoobee stumbled and struggled a long the way in this degree, but my own love for this subject and the world of development is what has driven me to where I am today.

In the first year, my final assignment was to create an application using the Qt Framework and C++. My original tutor put her foot down which caused Yoobee Wellington to have no tutor for it's first ever Software Engineering class at the very end, and we were forced to learn Qt ourselves with a game development tutor that only new C#. To be fair, he was amazing after stepping in on such short notice and it was clear he had to teach himself Qt at the same time. I ended up with an awesome library system, where I learned about handling data in CSV files and working with multiple team mates in a project. It was a hell of an end to the first year.

My second year wasn't much better, and we had yet another tutor. This tutor told us he only knew Python from using it for scripting in Maya, an animation software. He wasn't a programmer by any means, and he made sure to tell us, but again he went above and beyond to teach us everything he could while the Yoobee management was struggling to find a curriculum. In this year I ended up creating an education platform using Python and Flask with an awesome team mate.

And you guessed it, third year was a new challenge as well. Yoobee had shoved us fully online with no warning at all. Our new tutor (again) found out that we were never taught algorithms and data structures in our first year, and took it upon himself to give us a crash course in it.

My first project this year was a game in Unity about climbing the mountain of life and collecting orbs that gave you different powers to view the world from a different perspective. I enjoyed using Unity and absolutely adored C#, but I wanted to keep the game development as a hobby while I was studying to focus on building my core programming skills instead.

My second project this year is my pride and joy, the Argo Company Management System. I used a plethora of technology in this project, from ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core to SignalR and JavaScript. I implemented real-time notifications, customised Microsoft's Identity api, included role-based authorisation and managed to deploy the app to Azure. My first year self would never in a million years think I was capable of creating something like this.

Here I am, 23 years old and two weeks from finishing my degree. I stand as a testament to my own willpower, not allowing my past to dictate who I am today. Through the ups and downs of Yoobee and my own will to teach myself development, I can stand here excited and fulfilled. There is a battle in life, and I embrace it.
